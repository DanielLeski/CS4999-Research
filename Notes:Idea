Notes for the Research Project:

Tuesday Feb 1st:

SVM GOAL: Deduce how good or bad each possible amino acid nucleotide interaction is in each of the four canonical contacts. 

Canonical Structure Model to represent each potential protein-DNA complex by a feature vector x. 

Given data within the databas:
	- Positive Examples (protein binds the DNA)
	- Negative Examples (protein does not bind to the DNA)
	- Comparative Examples (one protein - DNA pair represents a stronger binding than another protein- DNA pair).

For each example within the database, they are shown within a vector representation
	- For linear models, all examples are considered at the per-protein level (including contacts from all fingers).
	- Polynomial SVM, in order to limit the pairwise interactions to contacts within individual zinc fingers. 

Ex+ -> Positive Example
Ex- -> Negative Example
Ex> -> One protein - DNA pair representes a stronger binding than another protein - DNA pair. 

A positive sample is considered at Kd < 200nM is considered a positive example. 

Gather a weight vector that accuractely seperates the binding and non binding examples.



Questions: 
DNA pair + f1 + f2 + f3 = one feature vector example?
How to use the conanical model for binding with these examples?
