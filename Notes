SVM GOAL: Deduce how good or bad each possible amino acid nucleotide interaction is in each of the four canonical contacts. 

Canonical Structure Model to represent each potential protein-DNA complex by a feature vector x. 

Given data within the databas:
	- Positive Examples (protein binds the DNA)
	- Negative Examples (protein does not bind to the DNA)
	- Comparative Examples (one protein - DNA pair represents a stronger binding than another protein- DNA pair).

For each example within the database, they are shown within a vector representation
	- For linear models, all examples are considered at the per-protein level (including contacts from all fingers).
	- Polynomial SVM, in order to limit the pairwise interactions to contacts within individual zinc fingers. 

Ex+ -> Positive Example
Ex- -> Negative Example
Ex> -> One protein - DNA pair representes a stronger binding than another protein - DNA pair. 

A positive sample is considered at Kd < 200nM is considered a positive example. 

Gather a weight vector that accuractely seperates the binding and non binding examples.

Questions: 
DNA pair + f1 + f2 + f3 = one feature vector example?
How to use the conanical model for binding with these DNA examples? 

For the SVM we need to having floating point numbers for the DNA .. do we do a conversion for these DNA sequences based on their amino acid value?

"We apply the widely used support vector machinery to do this. Given a dataset of training examples xi, SVMs search for a weight vector w that best separates binding and non-binding examples"

What is xi in this case? From my interpretation it is not the canonical binding structure so it is the DNA and or ZF domains. 

TODO:
Make a jupyter notebook making with all of the 80 categorical variables the 20 amino acids and 4 bases and dummy variables for hotencoding to run it through a random forest and see how it goes with that. 

Try 1 column is the contacts and the other columns are the 80 combinations of the 20 amino acids and the 4 bases and then perform hot encoding.

Feb 6th:

Create a matrix with all of the positive and negatives samples and use a 0 or 1 for a label for them

One column of contact points and the other ones are the categorical variables

GOALS: 

Try to figure out the 4N(DNA) to the 7N(Zinc Finger) then create a those as features and the other as categories
